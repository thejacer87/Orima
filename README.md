# Orima
My first attempt at making a platforming game (or any game for that matter). Build using the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

It's clearly "inspired" by the original [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.). As I am just trying to get my feet wet in gamedev, and I am not creative at all, I figured I would try to remake a classic game. 

All the sprite were created by me. Some were definitely made while look at a close up of the sprite from the actual game (looking at you ground sprites).

Most sounds and music were downloaded from [The Mushroom Kingdom](https://themushroomkingdom.net/media/smb/wav). I'm not even sure if I am allowed to use them or not. Plz no lawsuits Nintendo.

## Naming Origin
According the [Smash wiki](https://supersmashbros.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Olimar), Captain Olimar's name was derived from saying Mario backwards in Japanese. So I just didn't anglicize it.

> prior to translation from Japanese to English "Orima", is "Mario" backwards in Japan, since there are no letters, only symbols that dictate sounds (Ma-Ri-O and O-Ri-Ma)
